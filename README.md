# Academic Papers and Presentations

This repository contains a selection of peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and presentations based on my academic research. In these works, I use statistical techniques frequently utilized in the social sciences but less common in data science, such as *structural equation modeling*, *multilevel modeling*, and *social network analysis*.
